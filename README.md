## This repository contains my final project for my Digital Product Management class. I created a professional profile website. This project made me utilize HTML, CSS, Azure and Google Analytics in order to create my website and track its engagements.

##In order to use this:

#1. Copy my code's URL
#2. Clone the repository in Github Desktop
#3. Edit the index and resume html files to include your info
#4. Change the CSS file if you want visal differences.
#5. Create a static website on Azure and utilize your own personal domain (ex:nathannesler.com)
