      <h2>About Nate</h2>
      <p>
        I grew up in a small town in Illinois called Genoa. I lived on a farm where we farmed 4200 acres of corn and soybeans.
        The University of Iowa has always been my dream school. My mom came here so I have been going to Kinnick for games for as long as I can remember.  
        I am a Senior studying BAIS at the Tippie College of Business. I will be working at Ernst & Young in the Des Moines location starting in the summer.
        I will be working as a Technology Risk Consultant and can't wait to get started.
