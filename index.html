      <h2>About Nate</h2>
      <p>
        I am from a small town in Northern Illinois called Genoa. I grew up on a 4200 acre farm with my parents and brother. 
        Our farm now has 3 generations working on it. My brother, cousins, and I spent 15 years running a self service pumpkin stand 
        and saved every penny to pay for our college. I could not be more thankful for growing up on a farm. 
      </p>

        After high school, I decided to attend the University of Iowa,and study in the Tippie College of Business. 
        I am a Business Analytics Major that will be graduating in May. I look forward to my professional career after college. 
        I accepted a Technology Risk Consultant position with Ernst & Young. I will be moving to Des Moines and can't wait to see a new 
        city and take on a new adventure
      </p>
      
      <p>
        My favorite things to do in my free time is to attend sportin events. I love the Bears, Cubs, Bulls and of course, the Hawkeyes. 
        I also love spending time at the lake fishing and doing watersports. I love wakeboarding and tubing in particular. I also love being competitive
        with my friends playing games like bags, spikeball and pickleball.
